# NatA Lang - Custom Language for Compilers Course

## Project Overview

NatA Lang is a custom programming language developed as part of the CST8152 Compilers course at Algonquin College. This language was designed to explore and demonstrate key concepts of compiler construction, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and parsing. The project was created in collaboration with [Your Friend's Name].

## Project Structure

- **input/**: Contains input files used for testing the language features.
- **out/**: Directory where output files are generated.
- **Compilers.c/h**: Contains the main logic for the compiler, including the implementation of core functions used across the project.
- **MainReader.c**: Handles the reading of input files and processing of the source code written in NatA Lang.
- **MainScanner.c**: Implements the lexical analysis (scanner) for NatA Lang.
- **Reader.c/h**: Implements utilities for reading and processing input data.
- **Scanner.c/h**: Implements the scanner functions, including tokenizing the source code and identifying keywords, identifiers, and literals.
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Configuration file for building the project using CMake.
- **CMakePresets.json**: Contains preset configurations for building the project in different environments.
- **launch.vs.json**: Configuration file for launching the project in Visual Studio.
- **git_log_image.jpg**: Image representing the Git log history or a related Git operation.

## Input Files

The `input/` directory contains several `.nat` and `.sof` files used for testing various features of NatA Lang:

- **INPUT0_Empty.nat**: A minimal empty file used to test how the compiler handles the absence of content.
- **INPUT1_Hello.nat**: A basic "Hello, World!" program to validate the basic functionality of output statements in NatA Lang.
- **INPUT2_Volume.nat**: Demonstrates the calculation of the volume of a sphere, showcasing the handling of mathematical expressions.
- **INPUT3_Factorial.nat**: Implements a simple factorial calculation, testing the loop and recursive capabilities of the language.
- **INPUT4_Datatypes.nat**: Tests the handling and declaration of various data types supported by NatA Lang.
- **INPUT5_Big.nat**: A larger, more complex program designed to stress-test the compiler's capabilities with a more substantial codebase.
- **INPUT6_Big.sof**: Similar to `INPUT5_Big.nat` but using the `.sof` file extension, demonstrating compatibility with different input formats.

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC or Clang.
- **CMake**: Required to build the project using the provided CMake configuration file.

### Building the Project

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   cd /path/to/NatA_Lang
2. **Generate the build files using CMake**:
   cmake -S . -B build
3. **Build the project**:
   cmake --build build
4. **The executable will be generated in the build directory.**

## Running the Compiler

After building the project, you can run the compiler by executing the generated binary. Follow these steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. **Run the executable**:
   - Ensure that all necessary files and folders are in place. Copy and paste the following folders and files into the directory `./out/build/x64-debug/`:
     - The `input/` folder containing your test files.
     - The executable file (`NatA.exe`) generated by Visual Studio or included for testing purposes.

2. **Update the Runner.bat file**:
   - Inside the `Runner.bat` file, replace the placeholder `testfile.nat` with the name of the actual `.nat` file you want to compile and run.

   **Note:** For now, the project includes a precompiled `NatA.exe` executable for testing. You can use this executable without needing to rebuild the project.

3. **Execute the Runner.bat file**:
   - Run `Runner.bat` to execute the NatA compiler. This will process the `.nat` file specified within the batch file.

4. **Output**:
   - The results of the compilation (or any errors) will be shown in a new `.err` file, and any output files (`.out`) will be saved in the `out/` directory.


## Example Programs
Example programs written in NatA Lang are located in the input/ directory. These include:

INPUT1_Hello.nat: A simple "Hello, World!" program.
INPUT2_Volume.nat: Demonstrates arithmetic operations.
